# SNAMP

Simple Neumorphic Audio and Music Player (SNAMP), is what it says it is. A simple music player that:

- Is completely ad-free (and free too but still)
- Auto-caches songs and music (for offline listening)
- Has built in speed controls (no more searching for slowed/sped up + reverb)
- Has a sleek, streamlined, easy to use UI, based on the design principles of neumorphism.
- Can search YouTube for your favourite songs, videos and playlists
- Can do much much more...
